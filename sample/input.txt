Welcome to MediumDesk

A Minimal Desktop App for Medium developed by Medium enthusiasts

MediumDesk is a simple app that lets you read and write Medium stories when you are at your desk.
MediumDesk extends medium.com’s experience to desktops. It is built by Medium enthusiasts with no intention to modify/replace any experience. I /emoji red heart/ Medium as it is. But a desktop app can do a few little things that a web app can’t and it gives a permanent home for Medium in my desktop. That is what MediumDesk is for. Every new feature will be selected based on this question : “Would Medium do it, If they built a desktop app?”.
